# US Drought Monitor — August 06, 2013

## Introduction


## Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico
In Hawaii, the recent rains were helpful but not enough to make any improvements, so status quo continued this week.  There were no changes in Alaska or Puerto Rico this week.

## Mid-Atlantic
Scattered precipitation and cooler than normal temperatures kept drought concerns from developing in the region.  The coastal regions received the most precipitation this week while portions of the West Virginia panhandle and southern North Carolina were the driest.

## Midwest
Wet conditions over portions of Illinois and Indiana were in contrast to the dryness over most of Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.  In Minnesota, D0 conditions were expanded while in Wisconsin, a new area of D0 was introduced.  Western Iowa had D1 conditions introduced, while D0 was pushed farther to the east.  Portions of southern Missouri recorded very heavy rain during the current week, allowing for some trimming of the southern edge of D0 in the state.  The D1 region in Missouri was also trimmed along the west edge, but pushed farther to the south as well.

## South
Dryness and warm temperatures in the area brought some expansion of the drought intensities.  D2 was increased in southeast Arkansas while the D0 and D1 conditions in the northwest improved.  For south Texas, D3 and D4 expanded, while in east Texas D0 was introduced into several counties.  Improvements were made in portions of the Texas panhandle and west Texas where the recent rains along with a generally wet pattern helped to improve the drought-related impacts.  In the Oklahoma panhandle, D4 was increased to the east as several counties have missed out on many of the recent rain events in the region and have season low precipitation totals.

## Southeast
A mostly wet week over most of the region with the greatest rains falling in northeastern Alabama and portions of west Georgia.  No drought concerns for this region at this time.

## The Northeast
Although the region was generally dry, cooler than normal conditions alleviated concerns about dryness or drought.  The greatest rains over the last week were recorded in Maine and portions of New Jersey.  No changes to the regional depiction this week.

## The Plains
Another week of very heavy rain amounts over much of Kansas allowed for a full category improvement of much of the drought status in the state, especially in the central and east.  Some counties reported several stations with 5+ inches of rain for the week. Not all areas of Kansas received the beneficial rains as most of western Kansas missed out again this week.   Farther to the north, D0 was removed from portions of southeast Nebraska and D2 was improved to D1 in southern Nebraska.  In northern portions of Nebraska, a full category improvement was made along the border with South Dakota, and in western Nebraska, D3 was improved and D4 removed.  South Dakota also had several areas improve, including a full category improvement in southern portions of the state as well as into western counties.  In northeast South Dakota, D0 was expanded because of short-term dryness.  North Dakota had D1 introduced and D0 expand as short-term dryness has started to impact the region.

## The West
Several areas of improvement took place in Colorado as the consistent rain has allowed for some green up of pastures and curtailed further degradation in many portions of the state.  In southeast Colorado, D4 was improved, while D3 was improved in the southwest.  In the north central portions of the state, D1 and D2 conditions were improved.  Wyoming has had some areas improve this week as D0 was removed from the far northeast portions of the state while D1 was improved in the southeast.  New Mexico had some adjoining areas to Colorado and Texas improved this week as the area received some scattered rain events.  In central New Mexico, D4 conditions were improved as the short-term conditions improved.  Improvements were also made in Arizona as many locations in the northern portion of the state had record to near record wetness for the month.  In the north central portion of the state, D3 was improved to D2 and in the southeast, D2 and D1 were both improved.  A large expansion of D3 conditions took place this week in Nevada, southwest Idaho, and eastern Oregon.  In Oregon, D1 was expanded in the central portion of the state, and in Utah, an area of D2 was expanded where hydrologic issues are continuing.

## Forecast
Over the next five days (August 8-11) Temperatures will continue to remain below normal over most of the country, with departures of 6-9 degrees Fahrenheit anticipated over the Plains and West Coast.  Above-normal temperatures are expected in the southern United States and the northern Rocky Mountains.  A wet pattern is likely to continue over much of Colorado, Kansas, and Missouri and into Kentucky and Tennessee.  The forecast is anticipating amounts of 3 inches over most of Kansas and western Kentucky.  Dry conditions are projected over most of the western United States and into Texas.
The CPC 6-10 day forecast (August 11-15) anticipates the best chances for below-normal temperatures will be over the Plains, Midwest, and Northeast, with the best chances for below-normal temperatures in the Great Lakes region.  The best chances for above-normal temperatures will be in the southern United States, Pacific Northwest and Alaska.  Most of the country has above-normal chances of recording above-normal precipitation during this time frame.  The greatest chances of above-normal precipitation will be over the Southeast.  The Great Basin, Southwest, and most of Texas have the best chances of recording below-normal precipitation for the period.

## Disclaimer
The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week.
