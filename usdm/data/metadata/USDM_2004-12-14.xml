# US Drought Monitor — December 14, 2004

## Introduction


## Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico
In Hawaii, scattered heavy showers fell on northern and eastern sections of the Big Island (Kona), further erasing the northern and eastern edges of the D0 area. Weekly totals included 1.03 inches at Upola, 1.35 inches at Kahua Ranch, and 1.18 inches at Kamuela. Just to the east, over 5 inches drenched Honokaa and Laupahoehoe. Western areas, however, received little or no rain, maintaining abnormal dryness there.
In Alaska, significant precipitation was limited to coastal areas, from the Aleutians eastward to the southeastern Panhandle, while interior and western locations were mostly dry. Temperatures averaged below normal in northern and eastern sections, and D0(H) remained.
In Puerto Rico, although September was a very wet month, drier than normal conditions have developed along the southwest and northwest coastal regions since October. Recently, less than 0.25 inches of rain fell last week, 4-week totals were between 0.1 and 5 inches or 3-40% of normal, and 8-week amounts were between 3 and 8 inches or 35-70% of normal, creating deficits of 4 to 8 inches.

## The Midwest and Great Plains
Significant precipitation (more than 2 inches) bypassed the region, falling instead on the Delta and Tennessee Valley. Light to moderate precipitation (0.5 to 1.5 inches), however, fell on the Great Lakes region, further alleviating any lingering abnormal dryness. In the upper Midwest and northern Great Plains, light snow (0.1 to 0.3 inches liquid equivalent) kept the area from further deterioration. Additionally, surplus October precipitation in the Dakotas kept recent short-term dryness at bay.
In contrast, the remainder of the northern half of the Plains and western Corn Belt received no precipitation, temperatures averaged 8 to 12F above normal, and highs reached into the 50s and 60s. Accordingly, D0 expanded slightly into southwestern Iowa and northwestern Missouri where subnormal precipitation has lingered in both the short- (30-day) and medium- (90-day) terms. Similarly in northeastern Montana, another dry and mild week slightly expanded D1 northward.

## The Southeast
Although the late fall, winter, and early spring months (November-April) normally record far less rainfall than the late spring to early fall months (May-October) in southern Florida, it has been much drier than usual since October, and especially since November 1. During the past 43 days, Miami reported 0.34 inches of rain, or 8% of normal (4.44 inches); at Ft. Lauderdale, 1.32 inches, or 23% of normal (5.8 inches); and Naples 1.60 inches, or 60% of normal (2.67 inches). So far during December, no rain has fallen at the first two locations. As a result, the KBDI (Keetch-Byrum Drought Index, a fire potential index) has crept upward toward 500 (dry; max=800), although impacts from the short to medium-term deficits (1 to 5 inches) have been negligible so far. According to NASS/USDA, most citrus growers continue to irrigate where rainfall has been sparse, and some areas have reported short to very short topsoil moisture levels. Fortunately, southern Florida has fared well both hydrologic- and hurricane-wise as Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne missed the area, but the storms copious rains that fell farther north drained southward into Lake Okeechobee, significantly raising its level.

## The West
A change in the upper-air jet stream allowed the Southwest to dry out and warm up as the storm track shifted northward, bringing significant moisture and storms to the Northwest. Moderate to heavy precipitation (over 2 inches, locally up to 11 inches) fell on western Washington and Oregon, northern California, Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and northern Rockies. After a slow start to the 2004-05 water year, the Northwest seasonal precipitation has improved since early December, increasing season-to-date (since October 1) average basin precipitation in Washington and Oregon from about 50-70% of normal (in late November) up to 70-100% of normal. Californias Sierra Nevada basins, which began the water year with significantly above average precipitation and snow pack, had started to decline, but the latest round of precipitation boosted average basin precipitation and snow water equivalent to well above normal. In addition, significant precipitation overspread the eastern halves of Washington and Oregon, much of Idaho, northern Nevada, and western Wyoming. In contrast to the cool conditions that had persisted across the West this Fall, temperatures were well above normal last week (+7 to +15F), resulting in more rain than snow, and some snow melt at higher elevations. For example, Brundage Ski Resort near McCall, ID temporarily closed this week because of warm weather and rain, creating poor skiing conditions. By closing, they hope to preserve the remaining snow for the holiday season. Nevertheless, average basin precipitation (and in some areas snow water content) increased by numerous percentage points, resulting in some improvement (one category) to the western-most edge of the drought area (D0-D3) in Washington, Oregon, northern California, Idaho, and northern Nevada. Elsewhere, tranquil weather across the remainder of the West kept conditions status quo.
Although this week was mostly beneficial to the Northwest, long-term drought and hydrologic concerns remained. As of December 1, statewide average reservoir capacities were still below normal in all Western States except Washington, according to the NRCS and California DWR. States with below normal capacities as of December 1 (% capacity: observed versus average; or % of normal) included: Arizona (32 vs 50; 64%);California (49 vs 57; 86%); Colorado (49 vs 61; 80%); Idaho (48 vs 63; 76%); Montana (60 vs 76; 79%); Nevada (9 vs 45; 20%); New Mexico (24 vs 52; 46%); Oregon (27 vs 45; 60%); Utah (25 vs 67; 37%); and Wyoming (39 vs 63; 62%). Only Washington was above normal (84 vs 82; 102%). Frequent stormy and cold weather, along with a slow spring snow melt, will be needed during the rest of the wet season to dent long-term deficits and aid in the filling of Western reservoirs.

## Forecast
The forecasted upper-air circulation pattern for the remainder of December features strong ridging (high pressure) over the Far West and deep troughing (low pressure) over the East. As a result, Pacific storms will track north into western Canada and southeastern Alaska, then dive southeastward toward the Northeast. This should produce mostly mild and dry conditions in the West, and cold and stormy weather in the East.
During the next 5 days (December 16-20), relatively tranquil weather (dry) will cover the lower 48 States until this weekend when a clipper system tracks from the Canadian Prairies southeastward into the Great Lakes region, deepening the trough over the East. Meanwhile, a developing low pressure center off the southern Atlantic Coast will move northward, bringing cold air, wind, and possibly heavy snow to parts of the mid-Atlantic and New England by weeks end. For the drought areas, this translates to: 1) unfavorably and unseasonably dry weather for the West and Plains; 2) above-normal precipitation for southern and eastern Alaska; 3) in Hawaii, El Nino conditions typically brings drier than normal conditions during November-May; 4) the troughing in the East may bring a cold front near or through Puerto Rico, touching off showers.
The 6- to 10-day outlook (December 21-25) calls for: 1) subnormal precipitation west of the Rockies, south-central Great Plains, northern Delta, Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys, with 2) surplus precipitation in the northern third of the Plains, along the Gulf Coast, in New England, and much of Alaska. Temperatures are predicted to be: 3) unseasonably cold in the northern Intermountain West, north-central Rockies, and eastern half of the Nation, with 4) above-normal readings limited to central California and most of Alaska.

The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week.
