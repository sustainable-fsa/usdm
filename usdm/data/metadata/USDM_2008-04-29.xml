# US Drought Monitor — April 29, 2008

## Introduction
A cold low pressure trough in the upper atmosphere moved across the country during this U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) period.  The weather system deepened as it reached the central U.S. and strengthened a surface Low and cold front.  Rain and thunderstorms with the front brought short-term relief to the Southeast drought areas, while rain associated with the surface Low dampened an area of dryness that had been developing in the Northeast.  A spring snowstorm on the back side of the Low dumped beneficial precipitation on the north central states.  Meanwhile, dry weather continued from California to the southern High Plains.

## Alaska
Several inches of precipitation fell along the southern coastal regions of the state, with a few tenths of an inch reported over the southern D0 area.  But in areas of eastern Alaska where snowpack remained well below average, there was no change to the D0 designation.  The rest of the state remained free of drought or abnormally dry classification.

## Hawaii
Heavy afternoon rains on a couple days provided short-term relief to parts of the Islands but otherwise this week has been drier than normal.  The continued dryness during at least the last 90 days has lowered streams, but groundwater resources in most areas provided adequate public water supplies and there were no reports of agricultural impacts.  No change to the depiction was made.

## Puerto Rico
More than 5 inches of rain fell over the northern and eastern parts of the island this week, while below-normal conditions prevailed in the south.   The D0 was pulled back in northwest Puerto Rico where the rain fell over the abnormally dry area.

## The Plains and Midwest
Six to 12 inches of snow, with locally heavier amounts, fell in a swath from South Dakota to Minnesota this week.  Consequently, D0 was contracted in northwest Minnesota and near the state line intersection of Minnesota and the Dakotas.  But D1 expanded in central South Dakota where precipitation totals averaged less than 50% of normal over the last 6 months.  The short-term dryness is beginning to affect winter wheat, while impacts from the multi-year dryness are beginning to show up in rangeland conditions.
In the southern High Plains, D1 expanded across the Texas Trans Pecos and northern Texas panhandle where dry weather persisted and soils were rapidly drying.  Less than 50% of normal precipitation has fallen across much of this area during the past 6 months.  D2 was added in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles into southwestern Kansas, where less than an inch of precipitation has fallen over the past 6 months.  Dalhart, Texas, has had 0.54 inch of precipitation since January 1, which is 2.68 inches below normal, and Lake Meredith had reached a record low and was still falling rapidly.  Boise City, Oklahoma, has had 0.50 inch for the year-to-date compared to a normal January-April total of 3.47 inches.  D0 and D1 were trimmed slightly in the northern Edwards Plateau of central Texas where 2 to 3 inches of rain fell this week.

## The Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast
Widespread rains of 1 to 2 inches brought short-term relief to much of the Southeast drought area during this USDM period.  Contractions to the drought areas were made in several states, but significant long-term deficits remained, ranging from 5-15 inches over the last 6 months to 12-20 inches over the last 12 months, with locally bigger deficits.  Surface conditions improved temporarily, but deeper soil moisture remained dry and groundwater levels and multiple-day averaged streamflows continued low in many places.  The Tennessee Valley Authority lakes continued low in spite of the recent rains.
D0 (abnormally dry) was removed in a hole over southeast Virginia where 4 to 8 inches of rain fell last USDM week and an additional 1 to 2 inches fell this week.  Two to 3 inch rains removed the spot of severe drought (D2) over central Virginia.  The D1 (moderate drought) was trimmed in Virginia and North Carolina.  The eastern edge of D2 in the Carolinas was pulled back.  Conservation measures and the rains of recent weeks have helped replenish many of the reservoirs in North Carolina, but low well levels and streamflows still reflected subnormal groundwater conditions.  The Catawba Basin in North Carolina has received less rain than areas to the east.  Consequently, the D3 (extreme drought) area was shifted westward in North and South Carolina.
Flooding on the Lower Mississippi River, plus locally heavy rains in Madison County, Louisiana, prompted pullback of the D0 along the Louisiana-Mississippi state line.  D0 was pulled back in central Mississippi, D1 dented in southern Mississippi, and D1 trimmed in northeast Mississippi where 1-3 inch rains fell.
After a generally wet fall, winter, and early spring, the Northeast experienced unusually dry weather during the last month and, in some areas, last 2 months.  Near record heat was reported during the last 2 weeks in western New York.  Stream levels dropped and several wildfires broke out in the region early this USDM week.  But widespread 1-inch, and locally 2-inch, rains late in the week brought temporary relief and held off the introduction of D0 to the Northeast.

## The West
Generally less than an inch of precipitation fell across the northern drought areas of the West this USDM week, but not enough to improve the drought depiction.  An inch or more was observed over parts of northwest California and the coastal Pacific Northwest, while the southern areas of the West received little or no precipitation with wildfires developing in places.
Melting of an abundant winter snowpack has filled reservoirs and increased streamflows in Arizona, which has helped urban areas.  But the last 8 weeks have been drier than normal and windy, with fire danger increasing.  D0 (abnormally dry) was expanded across the state to reflect parched conditions in the rural areas, and D1 (moderate drought) was expanded in the southeast and southwest corners.
D0 was expanded to the coast across California, except for the northwest corner, due to continued dryness.  According to news reports, the East Bay Municipal Utility District issued an urgent warning that water levels are critically low and that its Board of Directors may be forced to vote for mandatory water rationing at the May 13 meeting.  D1 expanded along the San Joaquin Valley, and the agricultural impact boundary was extended southward and to the coast, to reflect the persistent lack of rain and worsening soil moisture conditions.  D2 expanded in southern California.

## Forecast
Another in a series of low pressure systems and associated fronts will move across the nation Wednesday through Monday, May 5, bringing rain to the southern and eastern states and rain or snow to the north central states.  Precipitation amounts of a half inch to one inch are expected across the Southeast, with up to 2 inches over parts of the Northeast.  One to 3 inches of moisture are expected over parts of the western Dakotas.  A few tenths of an inch is forecasted for the northern parts of the West, while the weather should remain dry from California to the southern High Plains.  Colder-than-normal air will follow behind the front.
The pattern will continue for May 6-14:  Pacific weather systems should bring above-normal precipitation to southern Alaska then weaken as they move across the western U.S., and strengthen as they emerge over the central U.S.  Above-normal precipitation is expected for the central third of the country, including the central and northern Plains, Great Lakes, and Mississippi and Ohio valleys.  Dry weather is forecasted for northern Alaska, parts of the Far West, the Southwest and along the Rio Grande Valley, and most of Maine.  Colder-than-normal temperatures are predicted for the north central states, while warmer-than-average conditions are expected along the Southwest, Gulf Coast, and Northeast peripheries
