# US Drought Monitor — September 25, 2007

## Introduction
A winter-like storm moved from off the southern California Coast northeastward into the northern Plains, bringing unseasonably heavy, localized showers to the Southwest, cool conditions to the Far West, and moderate to heavy rain to parts of the central and northern Rockies.  In the Southeast, Tropical Depression 10 formed over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico but quickly faded once making landfall near Fort Walton Beach, FL, but not before dropping decent rains on most of Florida and southern Georgia.  And once again, widespread heavy showers and thunderstorms provided additional drought relief to the north-central Great Plains, upper Midwest, and western Great Lakes region.  In contrast, dry and warm weather returned to the remainder of the Southeast and the Ohio Valley, Northeast, and mid-Atlantic, either maintaining or expanding drought and dryness.  Elsewhere, light showers in Puerto Rico and on the windward side of the Hawaiian Islands kept conditions status-quo.

## Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico
Little or no precipitation fell on northeastern Alaska, and temperatures averaged 4 degrees F to 8 degrees F above normal.  However, with readings normally dipping below freezing at night, and average temperatures approaching 32 degrees F in the far north, D0 impacts were negligible as the state awaits the fall and winter snow season for building mountain snowpacks.  In Puerto Rico, scattered showers (under an inch, with a few isolated totals exceeding 2 inches) fell on southeastern sections.  They were not great enough to alleviate long-term dryness, nor light enough to increase to D1(H), so conditions remained at D0(H).  In Hawaii, scattered light windward showers (generally less than 0.25 inches) were not enough to improve conditions, with the possible exception of eastern Maui.  With good consistent windward rains, 7-day totals (from 8:45am HST Sep. 18 to 8:45am HST Sep. 25) included 6.14 inches at Puu Kukui, 3.25 inches at West Wailuaiki, and 2.00 inches at Oheo Gulch.  This may have been enough to drop mandatory water restrictions in eastern Maui, but it won't be known for sure until Thursday, Sep. 27 at the earliest.  Until confirmation is made, Hawaii remains at status quo.

## New England and eastern Great Lakes Region
With little or no rain, temperatures averaging 4 degrees F to 8 degrees F above normal, and highs in the mid-80s, short- to medium-term shortages further increased.  During the past 60-days, under half of normal rainfall occurred across extreme western and northern New York, accumulating deficiencies of 3 to 8 inches, and at 6-months, 8 to 12 inch deficits were observed in north-central New York.  Most USGS 1- and 7-day stream flows have fallen into the lower 10th percentile across the region, with near-record lows on the Black River at Watertown, and reported water shortages in the northern Adirondacks and in the headwaters of the Black River.  In northwestern Vermont, one town is trucking in water, but their water system is marginal and susceptible to dry conditions.  Although D2 was added into this area, with D0 and D1 expanding eastward and somewhat southward, large-scale negative impacts have been minimal with the growing season coming to an end, with conditions actually aiding harvest activities. Similarly in eastern New England, dry and warm weather increased deficiencies, especially after subnormal summer rainfall (50 to 75% of normal) in eastern Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.  After last week's 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain and minor improvement, no rain this week rapidly dropped USGS stream flows back under the 10th percentile, with several at record low levels.  In response, D1 was returned to eastern Connecticut and Rhode Island, and D0 slightly expanded westward.

## The Plains
Although light showers (0.2 to 0.4 inches) fell on most of North Dakota, precipitation has been well below normal the past 90-days (less than 50% of normal in the northwest, with deficits of  2 to 4 inches), creating short-term impacts.  According to local county extension agents, winter wheat plantings were reduced due to dry conditions, pastures and ranges have decreased production, and many normally active grasses have gone dormant.  On the other hand, the dry weather was good for harvesting activities.  As a result, abnormal dryness was expanded into the southwest, and moderate drought now covered northwestern North Dakota.  In contrast, 0.5 to 1.2 inches of rain in northeastern North Dakota, plus 1-3 inches in northeastern South Dakota, was enough to alleviate D0(A).  Additionally, an inch of rain fell on west-central Nebraska, trimming back the D0(A), but lesser amounts (less than 0.5 inches) fell nearby. The Impact line (AH) was redrawn to reflect lingering short (less than 30-days) and long-term (6- to 12-months) deficiencies in the north-central High Plains, but improved short-term conditions elsewhere (H only).

## The Southeast, Ohio and lower Missouri Valleys
After receiving heavy rains (more than 2 inches) from the remnants of Hurricane Humberto last week, little or no rain fell this week from southeastern Texas northeastward into southwestern Virginia and the Carolinas, so conditions stabilized in these areas.  In contrast, rain from weak Tropical Depression 10 brought widespread, decent rains (2 to 5 inches) to most of Florida and southern Georgia.  This week's rain, in combination with more scattered and moderate rain (1 to 2 inches) the previous week, was enough to provide some relief to eastern Florida, southern and central Georgia, and southeastern Alabama.  In eastern North Carolina, two weeks of decent rains nudged the D2 and D3 edge slightly westward, with improvement to counties near the Pamlico Sound and Onslow Bay.  Plus, with short-term conditions close to normal, the Impact line became H only (instead of AH) as long-term drought (1 to 2 years plus) remained.  In Florida, however, a general increase in rainfall coverage and intensity since July has yet to effectively eliminate hydrologic drought.  For example, the average level of Lake Okechobee has slowly crept upward to 9.86 feet, but this was still 5 feet below normal as of Sep. 25, and with the normally dry season fast approaching, water supplies were not looking good.  Additionally, USGS stream flows at various time periods still remained in the lower 10th percentiles at most sites in western Florida and the in the Panhandle.
In contrast, two consecutive weeks of little or no rain, plus a return to unseasonable warmth and highs in the 80sF and 90sF, rapidly deteriorated conditions in the northernmost extent of the drought area.  This was especially true in the Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic, with quickly accumulating short-term deficiencies, declining short-term drought indicator blends, very low soil moisture anomalies and percentiles, near or record low USGS stream flows at 1-, 7-, 14-, and 28-days, Sep. 23 NASS/USDA topsoil moisture rated short to very short (KY 95%; IL 69%; IN 69%; OH 52%; WV 70%; VA 87%; MD 80%; DE 92%, and PA 55%), and percent of pastures rated poor to very poor (55% in IL to 78% in KY).  To reflect this, D3 was expanded across southern Indiana and most of Kentucky, D0-D2 pushed northward into central Indiana, D0-D1 increased into central West Virginia, D1 extended into Maryland, D2 was put in north-central Virginia, and D0 increased in southern New Jersey.

## The Upper Midwest and western Great Lakes Region
For the fourth consecutive week, much of this region experienced moderate (0.5 to 2 inches) to heavy (over 2 inches) rains.  With the growing season effectively over plus dropping temperatures, evapotranspiration rates have also greatly decreased, meaning that any additional precipitation should start to 'accumulate' in the soil.  According to USDA/NASS, Minnesota topsoil moisture rated short to very short dwindled from 46% on Sep. 16 to 21% a week later.  With the continued precipitation surpluses and decreasing evaporative demands, a one-category improvement was made across most of the northern half of Minnesota and extreme northwestern Wisconsin, where over 5 inches fell in the latter area.  Heavy rains (2 to 5 inches) also soaked western sections of Michigan's upper Peninsula, producing short-term (30-day) surpluses of 2 to 5 inches, but long-term deficits still remained (6-months: 2 to 4 inches; 12-months: 4 to 8 inches).  Accordingly, D3 was removed near Lake Superior, but D2(H) remained, although another week of decent rain could provide further relief.  In northeastern Wisconsin, however, rainfall was much lighter (0.1 to 0.7 inches), and conditions were degraded to D2(AH) as USGS 1-, 7-, 14-, and 28-day stream flows ending Sep. 25 remained at near to record-low levels.  In northern lower Michigan, 0.3 to 0.6 inches of rain maintained D0-D1 conditions.

## The West
A cold core upper-air low, more typical of the winter than normally dry late September, slowly tracked from off the southern California Coast northeastward into the northern Plains, producing locally heavy showers and thunderstorms in parts of the Southwest.  Over 2 inches of rain fell on southern Nevada, central Arizona, southwestern Utah, and southwestern Colorado, with 0.5 to 2 inches common in northern and central Arizona, southeastern California, southern and eastern Nevada, most of Utah, western parts of Colorado and Wyoming, and most of Idaho and Montana.  Normally arid Death Valley, CA, received 0.63 inches on Sep. 22, its highest daily total in over 2 years.  While Las Vegas, NV, measured 0.67 inches, Mt. Charleston, just to the west of Las Vegas, recorded 5.90 inches.  Although much of the West was in hydrologic drought, this week's unseasonably heavy rains, an active Southwest monsoon during July and August, decreasing temperatures, and an end to the growing season have greatly lowered wildfire danger, increased topsoil moisture, and halted irrigation in much of Utah.  Although reservoir storage is still very low on the Bear (23%), Sevier (30%), and Weber (38%), the remainder of the state is close to normal conditions for late summer [Provo (76%), Uintah (76%), southern Utah (60%), southeast Utah (50%)].  Accordingly, the southern and eastern sections of Utah were improved to D1(H), along with northern Arizona and southwestern Nevada.  In Arizona, above-normal July and August monsoon rains helped raise the statewide reservoir percent of normal capacity from 82% at the end of July to 88% by the end of August.  In Colorado, a decent 2006-07 wet season as compared to the rest of the West, a wet August and September, and near-normal statewide reservoir capacity resulted in drought improvement for western sections, except in the northwest where the Yampa-White basin Sep. 1 SWSI (Surface Water Supply Index) was -2.5, or moderate drought.
Farther north, light to moderate rains eased topsoil moisture shortages in Idaho, western Montana, and western Wyoming, but statewide percent of normal reservoir capacities continued to drop since the end of May as compared to the end of August.  Montana went from 83% on May 31 to 75% on August 31; and similarly, Idaho 100% to 65%, Wyoming 96% to 79%, and Oregon 82% to 57%.  In addition, even with the recent rains, longer-term periods, starting at 60-days, show subnormal precipitation across much of the aforementioned areas, while USGS stream flows generally remain in the lower 25th percentile for the past  1-, 7-, 14-, and 28-day periods.  As a result, except for a very slight reduction in the D3(AH) in western Montana where 1-2 inches fell, a slight expansion of D0 in west-central Washington with recent dryness, and a reassessment of the D3(H) in eastern Idaho and northwestern Wyoming (very low reservoir storage on the Upper Snake River basin), conditions were maintained.  The Impact line for hydrology (H), however, was shifted northward to reflect the improved short-term moisture situation and decreased wildfire danger.  In fact, Idaho, suffering from one of their worst wildfire seasons on record, was down to only one active large wildfire on Sep. 25 thanks to the weekend moisture.  And, although the USDA/NASS pasture and range conditions on Sep. 23 were still bleak in California, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Oregon [very poor to poor ratings ranged from 58% (UT) to 95% (CA)], the rains had just fallen, so any possible improvements would not show up until next week.

## Forecast
For September 27-October 1, a cold front will bring a chance of showers (0.5 inches or more) from the Tennessee Valley northeastward into western New England early in the period, then move off the East Coast by late Friday, with dry and cooler weather in store for the eastern third of the nation.  Two systems will move through the Northwest, with precipitation possible on Friday and Monday, while more rain is forecast for the northern Plains and upper Midwest over the weekend.  Little or no rain is predicted for the southern half of the U.S. during late September, with near to slightly above normal temperatures.  In the tropics, Tropical Storm Karen (south-central Atlantic Ocean) and Tropical Depression 13 (southwest Gulf of Mexico) were far away from the lower 48 States and were not expected to affect the U.S. through October 1.
For the ensuing 5 days (October 2-6), the odds favor wetter-than-normal weather for the Pacific Northwest, northern Great Plains, upper Midwest, western Great Lakes region, Mississippi Valley, and Florida, while subnormal precipitation is expected in the Southwest and northeastern quarter of the nation.  Above-normal temperatures are forecast for the eastern half of the U.S., especially in the Northeast and Great Lakes region, with cool conditions in the western third of the nation.
