# US Drought Monitor — June 04, 2013

## Introduction
This U.S. Drought Monitor week saw overall improvements in some drought-stricken areas as significant rain fell across the Great Plains, Midwest, and northern interior portions of the West. In the West, heavy rainfall over the eastern half of Montana and northern Wyoming helped to ease drought conditions. Conditions continued to deteriorate in parts of the Southwest, Great Basin, and interior portions of the Pacific Northwest as a result of below-normal precipitation over the winter and spring months. Overall, temperatures were well above normal in the Southwest while much of the Intermountain West and Pacific Northwest were well below normal. Temperatures were below normal across most of the Great Plains and western portions of the Midwest while the eastern third of the conterminous U.S. experienced temperatures well above average – especially in New England and the Mid-Atlantic region. In Alaska, temperatures were above normal throughout most of the state, while precipitation was above normal in southeastern Alaska.

## Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico
The Hawaiian Islands saw improvements on the Big Island, Lanai, Maui, and Molokai. Alaska remained status quo for the week.

## Mid-Atlantic
The Mid-Atlantic region remained status quo on this week’s map.

## Midwest
Only minor adjustments in were made in the region for this week’s map. The remaining area of Abnormally Dry (D0) in northern Wisconsin was removed as one to two inches of rain fell over the area. In northwestern Minnesota and western Iowa, small areas of Abnormally Dry (D0) were removed as a result of heavy rainfall during the past week. Temperatures throughout the region were below normal west of the Mississippi River and generally above normal east of the Mississippi River.

## The Northeast
The Northeast saw minor improvements as rainfall in excess of two inches fell over portions of Connecticut and Massachusetts. As a result, areas of Abnormally Dry (D0) were removed in northwestern Connecticut and southeastern Massachusetts. Otherwise, the map remained unchanged. Temperatures throughout the region were well above normal over the past seven days.

## The Plains
In Oklahoma, heavy rainfall and severe weather continued this week. A sharp drought gradient has been developing between the eastern and western sections of Oklahoma. According to the Oklahoma Climatological Survey, El Reno, Oklahoma (site of the EF-5 tornado on May 31), had a 30-day total rainfall accumulation of 12.65 inches while neighboring Watonga to the west had only 2.4 inches for the same period. Much of eastern Oklahoma returned to normal or near-normal conditions, while the western one-third remained dry. This week, one-category improvements were made in central, north central, and northeast Oklahoma along the eastern edge of the drought boundary. In Kansas, heavy rainfall in excess of six inches fell over the southeastern portion, leading to one-category improvements in areas of Severe Drought (D2), Moderate Drought (D1), and Abnormally Dry (D0). In south central Kansas, improvements were made in an area of Extreme Drought (D3). Mirroring Oklahoma, the far western part of Kansas has been much drier with long-term deficits remaining, leading to a slight expansion of Exceptionally Dry (D4). In Nebraska, drought conditions eased as widespread rainfall ranging from one to five inches fell over the eastern two-thirds of the state. One-category improvements were made in areas Exceptional Drought (D4), Extreme Drought (D3), Severe Drought (D2), Moderate Drought (D1), and Abnormally Dry (D0). In South Dakota, heavy rainfall this week (two to seven inches) led to widespread one-category improvements in the northwestern quarter of the state. Temperatures throughout the region were below normal over the past week.

One-category improvements were made in areas Exceptional Drought (D4), Extreme Drought (D3), Severe Drought (D2), Moderate Drought (D1), and Abnormally Dry (D0). In South Dakota, heavy rainfall this week (two to seven inches) led to widespread one-category improvements in the northwestern quarter of the state. Temperatures throughout the region were below normal over the past week.

## The South
Modest rainfall over Arkansas and Texas led to some minor improvements this week. In Arkansas, locally heavy rainfall led to the removal of an area of Abnormally Dry (D0) in northwestern Arkansas. In the Texas Panhandle, moderate rainfall this week led to improvement from Exceptional Drought (D4) to Extreme Drought (D3). Continued longer-term dryness over west Texas and north central Texas led to expansion of areas of Exceptional Drought (D4) and Extreme Drought (D3). In southeast Texas, modest rainfall totals ranging from one to two inches led to one-category improvements from Severe Drought (D2) to Moderate Drought (D1). In east Texas, locally heavy rainfall in excess of three inches helped to improve areas of Moderate Drought (D1) and Abnormally Dry (D0). Temperatures were above normal throughout the region over the past week, with exception of northern Arkansas.

Temperatures were above normal throughout the region over the past week, with exception of northern Arkansas.

## The Southeast
The Southeast saw some minor improvements in areas of Abnormally Dry (D0) and Moderate Drought (D1) as a result of rainfall totals ranging from one to five inches over southwest and south central Florida. In southern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, continued below-normal precipitation and low streamflows led to the expansion of areas of Abnormally Dry (D0) and Moderate Drought (D1). Temperatures during the past week were above normal in Alabama, the Florida Panhandle, Georgia, and North Carolina while the eastern half of South Carolina and the southern half of Florida experienced below-normal temperatures.

Temperatures during the past week were above normal in Alabama, the Florida Panhandle, Georgia, and North Carolina while the eastern half of South Carolina and the southern half of Florida experienced below-normal temperatures.

## The West
During the last seven-day period, most of the West was generally dry, with the exception of Montana and northern Wyoming. Widespread heavy rain fell over the eastern half of Montana and the northeast quarter of Wyoming, helping to significantly improve drought conditions.  Some areas of central and eastern Montana received over eight inches of rain, leading to one- and two-category improvements in southeastern Montana. The combination of recent rainfall and near-normal winter precipitation led to one-category improvements across northern Wyoming, including the removal of an area of Extreme Drought (D3) along the Wyoming-Montana border. Conditions continued to deteriorate over southern Idaho, the northern Great Basin, and southeastern Oregon as a result of below-normal precipitation throughout the winter and spring months. One-category degradations were made in these areas. In California, below-normal precipitation for the Water Year (starting October 1) and wildfire-related impacts led to the expansion of areas of Severe Drought (D2) in southern California as well as central California. Currently, the Powerhouse fire in southern California has charred over 32,000 acres, marking an early start to the wildfire season in the California. In the Four Corners region, a new area of Extreme Drought (D3) was introduced in response to below-normal precipitation throughout the winter and spring months.

## Forecast
The NWS HPC 5-Day Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF) calls for heavy precipitation over the Southeast, Mid Atlantic, and New England while moderate precipitation amounts are forecasted over the South, Midwest, and High Plains. The 6–10 day outlooks call for a high probability of above-normal precipitation across New England and Mid-Atlantic states while the West sees a high probability of below-normal precipitation. Temperatures forecasted on the 6–10 day outlooks call for a high probability of above-normal temperatures across most of the West and the Plains while New England has a high probability of below-normal temperatures.
