# US Drought Monitor — November 02, 2010

## Introduction


## Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico
In Hawaii, good trade wind rains on the windward sides of the Big Island, Maui, Molokai and Oahu lead to improvements on this week’s map in the form of general 1-category improvements. The Big Island saw a good chunk of D3/D4 removed and the windward side is free and clear of drought/dryness at this time. The same goes for windward Maui, Molokai and Oahu where a retreat of D0-D3 was seen, leaving the windward sides clear of D0. Streamflows and reservoirs have been responding favorably in the areas showing improvement. The lee sides remain in D0-D3, thus mitigation measures and mandatory water restrictions remain in place as a precaution.
Alaska and Puerto Rico remain unchanged from last week.

## Texas and Oklahoma
Dry weather dominated the landscape last week for all but parts of southeastern Texas (3-4 inches in and around the Houston metro and points north and east of the vicinity). In Oklahoma, D0 expands mostly to the north and east into southeastern Kansas and extreme southwestern Missouri. As we move south into Texas, it was more of a mixed bag with heavy rains leading to 1- to 2-category improvements (D1 to no dryness/drought locally) in and around the Houston vicinity where the heaviest rains (3-5 inches or more) fell. In general, conditions eased somewhat as you moved north and east from there toward Louisiana, with a trimming on the south edge of the D1. As for the rest of Texas, expansion is on the plate this week with a push of D0 north toward Dallas and a push south along the Rio Grande toward Brownsville.

## The Midwest and Great Lakes
Improvement is noted this week across the Arrowhead region of Minnesota in the removal of D2 and a reduction of D1 and D0 on the southern edge. Recent rains have helped ease the hydrological situation in that region. After some locally beneficial rains last week held deterioration at bay across much of Indiana, a return this week to little in the way of rains, coupled with above-normal temperatures, led to an expansion northward of D1 and D2. All but extreme northwestern Indiana is now in at least D1, with the southern half of the state in D2 and/or D3 along the Ohio River valley region. The D0-D1 has also encroached upon southern Michigan after a short reprieve. To the west of Indiana, eastern Illinois also sees more nudging of D1 to the west across the southern half of the state. Kentucky also continues to see warm temperatures and spotty rains with the general conditions still trending toward intensification. In fact, the latest press release (October 28) out of the Kentucky Governor’s Energy and Environment Cabinet (Drought Task Force input) shows 50 counties in a Level 2 designation (Level 3 being the worst) along with another 42 counties at Level 1. The D0-D2 in Kentucky has pushed more south and east this week and the same holds true for western and central Tennessee, where D1-D2 now blankets this region. Things continue to be warm and dry across the Bootheel region of Missouri as well and D2-D3 continues to expand and entrench itself this fall. Streamflow (lowest 2-5 percentiles) and soil moisture readings are quite low in the drought regions outlined above as we head into the critical soil recharge season. One general positive out of the recent dryness, though, has been found in the form of excellent harvesting conditions.

## The Northeast and Mid-Atlantic
After some improvement last week, a relatively quiet week ensued, which leads to no changes in the map in the Northeast. A mixed bag of weather brings mixed changes to the Mid-Atlantic, where southern and southwestern Virginia saw 2-3 inches of rain or more in places. Above-normal temperatures (2-5 degrees) were widespread as well. This led to the removal of some of the D0 along the central stretch of the Virginia-North Carolina border. The D0 depiction for the rest of VA remains unchanged this week.
More changes are reflected this week across the Carolinas, mostly in the way of improvements after a narrow band of 3-5 inches of rain fell across western North Carolina and some 1-2 inch plus rains fell in central South Carolina. These areas saw a 1-category improvement from D2/D1 down to D1/D0. In eastern North Carolina, the rains haven’t materialized much over the past two months or so, leading to a slight push of D0 to the east. Another area that missed out on the heavy rains to the east in northwestern North Carolina (Blue Ridge vicinity) goes from D0 to D1 this week as well.

## The Plains
Most of the central Plains remain unchanged this week. A small amount of D0 has moved over the border from Oklahoma into southeastern Kansas.

## The Southeast and Gulf Coast
The biggest benefactors last week were found in parts of central and northern Alabama along with northern Georgia, where rainfall totals of 1-4 inches were reported in many locales. The areas under the heavier rains (2-3 inches or more) were reduced one category, leading to some trimming of D0-D2 in those regions. However, D2-D3 remains well in place across southern Alabama and parts of the Florida Panhandle. Other parts of the Southeast weren’t as fortunate as the dryness and above-normal temperatures of the past 60-90 days (due to a lack of tropical moisture this hurricane season) are beginning to really dry things out, particularly range and pasture lands. Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama are all reporting (via USDA) around 70% of Pasture and Range Land as in “Poor or “Very Poor” condition as of October 31. D1 and D2 continue to work their way west and north across Arkansas as streamflow levels continue to sag. In Louisiana, heavy rains across southwestern and south-central parishes led to a 1-category improvement in those areas seeing 3-5 inches. Heavy rains (2-4 inches) also fell across northwestern Louisiana, leading to some trimming of the D1-D3 found there. These rains were badly needed, but the core of this drought still remains across much of central and western Louisiana and more rains would be welcomed.
A bit to the east and south, D2 now stretches across the southern tier counties of Georgia, and D0 now covers all of central Georgia in a change from last week. Florida also sees more in the way of worsening drought conditions in both the south and north. Southern Florida sees a slight expansion of D0 south and east across the peninsula. In the northern half of the state, D0-D2 now covers the entire Big Bend region in a push to the west as the lack of rain over the past 30-90 days is coupled with low streamflow values as well. Flows in and around the Lower Suwannee are at 10-year lows, and in the Upper Suwannee and Santa Fe, flows are approaching record lows from 2007, according to the Suwannee River Water Management District. The Panhandle remains in D2-D3 this week.

## The West
After a beneficial early storm system brought improvements to last week’s map, this week holds steady after a much quieter week over our defined dry/drought regions across the West.

## Forecast
The forecast for the next five days (through November 8) is showing a large bubble of above-normal (3-12 degrees) temperatures falling across the entire West, with cooler temperatures (3-9 degrees) expected east of the Mississippi River valley. Most of the West (except for coastal plains and interior Pacific NW) and central U.S. are expected to be high and dry over this period. East of the Mississippi and up the Atlantic Seaboard, moderate rains (spotty in nature) are forecasted.
The CPC 6-10 day forecast (November 9-15) calls for a flip-flop of temperatures from the 5-day forecast above, with below-normal readings likely in the West and above-normal temperatures highly likely in the East, particularly the Midwest and Northeast. As for precipitation, below-normal rains are expected across the coastal Pacific NW, the Southwest, the entire Gulf Coast region from Texas to Florida and up the Atlantic coast into southern Georgia and the eastern Carolinas.
Alaska looks to be both cooler and drier over the 6-10 day period.

## Disclaimer
The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week.
