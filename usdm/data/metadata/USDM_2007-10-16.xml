# US Drought Monitor — October 16, 2007

## Introduction


## Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico
Slow but steady improvement continues across Hawaii this week as the trade wind showers have led to reductions of D0 on the windward sides of Maui, Molokai, and Oahu. No changes were made this week in Alaska or Puerto Rico. Little or no rain fell in the D0 area in Alaska and most of the beneficial rains in Puerto Rico were just off to the east.

## The Northeast
The Northeast went through another unseasonably warm week that was generally accompanied by plentiful rains in several places. Parts of northern New York, northeast Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey, western Massachusetts, and Connecticut, along with most of Maine, saw anywhere from 1-4 inches on the week. In general, a one-category improvement was incorporated on the map this week with a removal of D2 and reduction of D1 in northern New York and removal of most of the D0 found in Maine. The D0-D1 was also trimmed in northeastern Pennsylvania, western Massachusetts, western Connecticut, and northern New Jersey. The only expansion this week was found in western New York, where the rains missed, leading to a creeping westward of D0 and D1 along Lake Ontario's shores onto the shores of Lake Erie in extreme northwestern Pennsylvania.

## The Plains
Temperatures were cooler across the northern Plains while the southern Plains were above normal for the week. Just like last week, good rains accompanied the cooler temps via a nice slow-moving storm system in the north, with the heavy rains leading to an eastward push of the D0 and D1 in eastern Kansas and west central Missouri as both short- and long-term periods are now in the normal range for most locations in these areas. In the south, the heat and dryness has led to a slight expansion of D0 in southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, northeastern New Mexico, and the Oklahoma Panhandle. Deficits over the past 90 days are beginning to show signs of stress in soil moisture heading into the winter recharge period. Farther north in the Dakotas it is more of a mixed bag with North Dakota remaining much drier than their neighbors to the south. A slight increase in D1 and D2 is noted this week in North Dakota in particular as dryness over the past 90 days is keeping the attention of producers heading into winter. The persistent dryness across much of the winter wheat belt is something to keep an eye on as we move forward this year and into next. In South Dakota, things have been a bit better. Rains of the past week coupled with those of the past 2 to 3 months have led to a bit of erosion of the D0, D1 and D2 in the southwestern part of the state. In fact, most of the severe (D2) drought has been pushed south into the Nebraska Panhandle.

## The Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, Ohio and lower Missouri Valleys
In general, another week of warm, dry weather dominated this part of the country. Isolated storms brought relief to a relative few areas, and none were enough to improve on the situation. Many locations continue to build up their year-to-date deficits in what is turning out to be one of the driest years on record in many locales. As a result, only expansion of drought is reflected on this week's map, with D1-D4 expanding to the west, north and east. The areas of most notable expansion include Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina, with more subtle deterioration noted in Tennessee and Virginia. In North Carolina, the governor has issued a statewide ban on burning and has asked citizens there to stop non-essential water use as several communities have only a few months of water supply remaining. This is also the case in some locales in northern Georgia, where the governor has also pleaded with citizens to voluntarily find other ways to conserve water besides the usual outdoor watering restrictions in place.

## The Upper Mississippi Valley and western Great Lakes Region
Both of these regions enjoyed more seasonably cooler weather, although it wasn't all that wet. However, the benefits of the past 30-90 days are beginning to emerge and this has led to the removal of all D2 from Minnesota along with the removal of D1 in the Lake Superior shores north of Duluth. In addition, both D0 and D1 have been reduced along the Minnesota/Wisconsin state line and over into northwest Wisconsin. Normal or above-normal totals exist now all the way out to year-to-date. Good rains were seen in the western reaches of Michigan's Upper Peninsula and a slight reduction of D0 is noted on the map in the Keweenaw Peninsula and Huron Mountain regions. As noted periodically in our report, the Great Lakes themselves are quite low and will remain so until such time as a wetter pattern is established over the region.

## The West
Much of the west coast and Intermountain West saw a cool down last week. Rains weren't as widespread, however, with the only significant precipitation (1-2 inches) occurring in the northern coastal reaches of California and extreme southwest Oregon along with north central Colorado and extreme southeastern Wyoming. These short-term rains and longer-term wetness led to a reduction of abnormally dry (D0) in both areas. For now, conditions remain unchanged elsewhere in the West as the new water year is just getting started.

## Forecast
During the next 5 days (October 18-22), a continuation of very unseasonably warm (6-12 degrees above normal) temperatures is expected across the eastern half of the country with the warmest readings most likely occurring in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Rainfall during this period looks good for the Pacific Northwest, Intermountain West, and northern Rockies. In addition, the upper Midwest, central Plains, New England states, and the Southeast in general could see some much-needed rains.
The 6-10 day outlook (October 23-27) is calling for a bit of a change in the current pattern, with likely ridging in the West leading to above-normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation across much of the West and northern Plains. The good news is that cooler weather is expected over the southern Plains, the South, Southeast, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic. Wetter-than-normal conditions are more likely across the South, Southeast, and New England states.
In addition, the continued strengthening of La Niña conditions in the equatorial Pacific doesn't bode well for the extreme drought in the Southeast as warmer and drier winters across the southern tier states are typically expected with this cool water phase.

## Disclaimer
The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week.
