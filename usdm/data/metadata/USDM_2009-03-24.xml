# US Drought Monitor — March 24, 2009

## Introduction


## Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico
Alaska and Puerto Rico remained free of dryness and drought.  Meanwhile, no changes were introduced in Hawaii, despite locally heavy showers in windward locations.  Hawaiian drought persists primarily in leeward sections of Molokai, Maui, and the Big Island.

## The Great Lakes
Precipitation associated with a major spring storm moved into the upper Great Lakes region toward the end of the monitoring period.  Rainfall totals in excess of 1 inch resulted in the removal of abnormal dryness (D0) from northeastern Minnesota, and a slight reduction in the coverage of abnormal dryness and moderate drought (D0 and D1) in south-central Minnesota.

## The Plains
A strong, early-spring storm brought a variety of weather conditions to the nation's mid-section from March 22-24.  Blizzard conditions engulfed the High Plains from eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska into the western Dakotas, while severe thunderstorms raked portions of the east-central and southeastern Plains.  More than a dozen tornadoes were spotted on March 23 from the middle Missouri Valley southward into Oklahoma.
Abnormal dryness (D0) was eliminated from western North Dakota, where snowfall totals of 1 to 2 feet were observed.  The coverage of D0 was reduced in some snow-affected areas, including central and east-central Wyoming.  However, the storm brought little or no precipitation to the central and southern High Plains, where pastures, rangeland, and winter grains continued to suffer.  Moderate drought (D1) was introduced across much of eastern New Mexico and west-central Texas, and expanded in southeastern Colorado.  Severe drought (D2) was expanded slightly in western Oklahoma, while abnormal dryness (D0) was lifted northward to near the Kansas-Nebraska border.  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, topsoil moisture across the western one-third of Kansas ranged from 86% very short to short in the northwest to 100% in the southwest.  USDA also reported that more than half (57%) of the Texas winter wheat crop was rated in very poor to poor condition on March 22.  Elsewhere, Oklahoma's wheat was rated 40% very poor to poor on March 22, along with 19% of the crop in Colorado and 18% in Kansas.

## The Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic States
Short-term dryness continued to intensify across the middle Ohio Valley and the Mid-Atlantic States, resulting in a broad expansion of abnormal dryness (D0) and moderate drought (D1).  In the region of D1, Baltimore, Maryland, has endured its driest start to a calendar year during the nearly 140-year period of record.  Through March 24, Baltimore's year-to-date precipitation stood at 3.79 inches, just 40% of normal.
Meanwhile, more information about the impact of the previous week's 2- to 6-inch Southeastern rainfall totals resulted in additional reductions in drought coverage in intensity.  Extreme drought (D3) was removed from the southern Appalachians, and the coverage of severe drought (D2) was reduced.  Much of the remaining moderate drought (D1) in east-central and southeastern Alabama was also removed, as stream flows in this area remained robust in the wake of mid-March downpours.
Heavy rain fell in southeastern Florida, mainly in and near some of the east coast cities, but largely bypassed the remainder of the parched peninsula.  March 17-21 rainfall totaled 2.81 inches in Ft. Lauderdale, with nearby amounts locally ranging from 6 to 10 inches.  However, Ft. Lauderdale recently completed its driest winter on record, with a December-February rainfall total of just 0.39 inch (5% of normal).  Nevertheless, some severe drought (D2) was removed from the hardest-hit areas of southeastern Florida, replaced by abnormal dryness and moderate drought (D0 and D1).  Elsewhere, there was some modest expansion of severe drought (D2) deeper into interior southern Florida, including all of Lake Okeechobee.  The level of Lake Okeechobee has been falling steadily since a few weeks after the August 2008 passage of Tropical Storm Fay, and the lake's average surface elevation on March 24 stood at 12.32 feet (about 2 feet below the 1965-2007 average for the date).

## The West
During February, California's water-supply situation improved slightly, with the state's 151 intrastate reservoirs collectively gaining 2.365 million acre feet (771 billion gallons).  On March 1, the state's cumulative water storage stood at 18.046 million acre feet (5.9 trillion gallons), 72% of average for the date, according to the California Department of Water Resources.
Improvements in storage were due to stormy weather in February and early March that more than doubled the water content of the Sierra Nevada snow pack from 10 to 25 inches.  During an average year, the Sierra Nevada snow pack contains an average of approximately 29 inches of liquid by April 1.  The mountain snow, which melts during the spring and is captured by a network of reservoirs, provides a crucial source of water for northern and central California.  (The Colorado River basin, which includes Lakes Powell and Mead, is also an important source of California's water.)
A 2004 report by the Department of Interior indicated that at the beginning of the 21st century, 79% of California's water was used for agricultural purposes, 17% went to municipal requirements, and the remaining 4% was directed toward industry.  Of California's total water use in 2000, 40% came from wells and other ground sources, while 60% came from surface supplies such as rivers and reservoirs.  From 1950 to 2000, California's annual water use nearly doubled, from 25.0 to 43.1 million acre feet (MAF).  During the same period, the state's annual agricultural water consumption climbed from 23.1 to 34.2 MAF, while domestic use surged from 1.6 to 7.2 MAF.
Much of the increase in California's water consumption has been due to a population explosion.  According to the California Water Plan, the state's population between 1950 and 2004 surged from 10.7 to 36.5 million, with annual growth rates in recent years around 600,000 people.  Another issue complicating the assessment of drought in California is environmental requirements.  The California Water Plan (2005 Update), estimated 39.4 MAF of water is used for environmental flows, which are defined to include in-stream requirements, wild and scenic river flows, required Delta outflow, and managed wetlands water use.  Some of the environmental water is re-used by urban and agricultural water users.
During the March 17-23 monitoring period, light to occasionally moderate amounts of precipitation (mostly 2 inches or less) fell from the Pacific Northwest eastward into the northern Rockies and southward into the Sierra Nevada.  In all locations, totals were not sufficient to appreciably change the water-supply outlook for the spring and summer of 2009.
Farther south, precipitation continued to largely bypass eastern Utah and neighboring areas, where abnormal dryness (D0) was introduced.  In the new D0 region, water year-to-date (October 1 - March 24) precipitation averaged just 70 to 80 percent of normal, while the water equivalent of the high-elevation snow pack ranged from 60 to 75 percent of normal.  Elsewhere, moderate drought (D1) was expanded in parts of southern New Mexico, where both seasonal precipitation and snow water content are below 50 percent of normal in some river basins.

## Forecast
For the remainder of the week, a major spring storm system crossing the U.S. will produce heavy snow in the central and southern Rockies on March 26-27 and the southern Plains on March 27-28.  Snowfall accumulations in excess of 8 inches may occur from the Rockies of Colorado and New Mexico southeastward into parts of Oklahoma and Texas' northern panhandle.  Farther east, torrential rainfall could result in March 26-30 rainfall totals as high as 3 to 9 inches from the lower Mississippi Valley to the southern Appalachians.  Severe thunderstorms, bearing high winds, large hail, and isolated tornadoes, could accompany the Southeastern downpours.  Meanwhile, as much as 1 to 2 inches of rain will fall from the Ohio and middle Mississippi Valleys into the Northeast.  Elsewhere, mostly dry conditions will persist through March 30 in southern Florida and from California to the lower Rio Grande Valley, while cool, showery weather will persist in the northern Rockies and the Pacific Northwest.
The CPC 6- to 10-day forecast for March 31 - April 4 calls for cooler-than-normal weather across the western half of the U.S., while near- to above-normal temperatures will prevail in the East.  Meanwhile, above-normal precipitation from the Pacific Northwest to the upper Great Lakes region will contrast with drier-than-normal conditions from California to the southern Plains.
