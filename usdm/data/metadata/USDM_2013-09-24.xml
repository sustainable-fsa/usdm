# US Drought Monitor — September 24, 2013

## Introduction
Rain lingered in parts of Colorado and neighboring states for a few days in the wake of historic flooding, but mostly dry weather thereafter allowed recovery efforts to progress.  However, a flood crest on the South Platte River coursed through northeastern Colorado and southwestern Nebraska, inundating some agricultural lowlands.  Meanwhile, the tropical plume of moisture partially responsible for Colorado’s flooding shifted eastward in advance of a cold front.  As a result, 1- to 3-inch rainfall totals were common along and east of a Wisconsin-to-Texas line.  The rain temporarily halted fieldwork, including harvest activities and winter wheat planting, but aided some late-developing summer crops.  Even heavier rain, locally 4 inches or more, curtailed fieldwork but eased drought from central and eastern Texas to the Mississippi Delta.  Elsewhere, generally dry weather across the Southwest and the northwestern half of the Plains contrasted with scattered showers from the Pacific Northwest to the northern Rockies.  The weather change in the Southwest signaled the end of the summer rainy season, while dry weather on the northern Plains promoted winter wheat planting and other fieldwork.

## Hawaii and Alaska
In Hawaii, stricter cutbacks (from 20 to 30%) in irrigation water usage for the Kualapuu Reservoir led to degradation to extreme drought (D3) on part of Molokai.  In addition, moderate drought (D1) replaced previously dry (D0) conditions on many other parts of Molokai.  Farther east, trade winds have delivered below-normal rainfall in recent weeks on the windward side of the Big Island, allowing abnormal dryness (D0) to expand to the coast.  From September 1-24, Hilo’s rainfall totaled just 2.17 inches (28% of normal).  Near the southern tip of the Big Island, very poor pasture conditions led to degradation from severe to extreme drought (D2 to D3).
The drought depiction was unchanged in Alaska, as cold, mostly dry weather settled across the mainland.  Fairbanks reported its first autumn freeze (29°F) on September 15, followed 3 days later by its first measurable snowfall (0.6 inch).  Meanwhile, heavy precipitation fell in non-drought areas of southeastern Alaska, where Ketchikan netted 12.22 inches of rain from September 15-23.

## The Great Plains
Like the Midwest, varying amounts of rain dampened the Great Plains.  Heavy rain soaked much of the southeastern half of Texas, while another significant rainfall event drenched northeastern Colorado and neighboring areas.  Both areas saw substantial reductions in drought coverage and intensity.  However, little or no rain fell in several other parts of the region.  In the heart of Colorado’s flood zone, an official observation site in Boulder received 16.69 inches of rain during the first half of September.  Boulder’s previous wettest month had been May 1995, when 9.59 inches fell.  According to emergency operations reports, Colorado’s flooding claimed seven lives, destroyed nearly 1,900 homes, and damaged more than 16,000 others.  Meanwhile, month-to-date precipitation climbed to 6.80 inches in Cheyenne, Wyoming, most of which (5.80 inches) fell from September 9-16.  Prior to this year, Cheyenne’s wettest September had occurred in 1973, when 4.52 inches fell.  In Nebraska, a record-setting crest on the South Platte River passed Roscoe (3.20 feet above flood stage) on September 20, and arrived 3 days later in North Platte (1.36 feet above flood stage).  Previous high-water marks had been observed in June 1995 at Roscoe and in June 1935 at North Platte.  The Platte River at Brady, Nebraska, crested 3.23 feet above flood stage on September 23, surpassing the May 1973 high-water mark by more than a foot.  Despite all of the rain, rangeland and pastures across some parts of the Great Plains continued to suffer from the cumulative effects of multiple drought years.  On September 22, rangeland and pastures were rated at least one-third very poor to poor several states, including Texas (54%), Colorado (43%), Nebraska (40%), and Kansas (36%).

## The Lower Mississippi Valley
Torrential rain spread across the lower Mississippi Valley, which had been suffering from short-term drought.  As a result, one- to locally two-category drought reductions were noted in Louisiana, Mississippi, southern Arkansas, and neighboring areas.  In Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where 4.26 inches of rain fell on the 20th, it was the wettest September day since 1886.  The region’s rain halted fieldwork, including harvest activities, but boosted moisture in advance of the winter crop establishment period.  By September 22, topsoil moisture was still rated 41% very short to short in Arkansas and Louisiana, although those numbers represented a significant improvement from the previous week’s figures of 78 and 52%, respectively.

## The Midwest
Scattered but locally heavy showers dampened the Midwest, easing dryness and drought in some areas.  However, rain bypassed other locations, resulting in a Midwestern mix of drought improvement and deterioration.  In particular, heavy rain nearly erased abnormal dryness (D0) from Ohio and nearly eradicated moderate drought (D1) from Indiana.  With 3.44 inches of rain on September 19, South Bend, Indiana, experienced its 11th-wettest calendar day on record.  Yet, at the same time, dryness (D0) expanded in southern sections of Indiana and Illinois, while coverage of severe drought (D2) increased in central Illinois.  The remainder of the Midwest—including Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and the eastern Dakotas—also had a variety of changes.  By September 22, topsoil moisture was still rated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture at least half very short to short in Iowa (77%), Missouri (69%), Illinois (66%), South Dakota (62%), Nebraska (61%), and Wisconsin (55%).  On the same date, USDA rated at least half of the pastures in very poor to poor condition in Iowa (62%) and Wisconsin (58%).  And, more than one-quarter of the corn and soybeans were rated very poor to poor in Wisconsin (29 and 29%, respectively), Missouri (27 and 33%), and Iowa (27 and 29%).

## The Northeast
The passage of a cold front delivered widespread rain, mainly on September 21.  Any consideration of expansion of abnormal dryness (D0) was curtailed by the front, which provided about a week’s worth of rain in a single day.  However, developing short-term dryness remained a concern, with many Northeastern locations reporting less than an inch of rain during the first 3 weeks of September.  Slightly longer-term rainfall deficits, stretching back to at least mid-summer, remained largely intact in abnormally dry (D0) areas from the northern Mid-Atlantic States into southern New England.

## The West
With the 2013 summer rainy season having ended across the Southwest in mid-September, further assessment of the robust monsoon led to additional reductions in drought coverage and intensity in the Four Corners States.  In southeastern Arizona, Douglas experienced its greatest monsoon season rainfall on record, with 16.24 inches of rain having fallen from June 15 – September 24.  Several other parts of Arizona also experienced near-record to record summer rainfall totals.  Farther north, some early-season precipitation from winter-like storms began to arrive in northern and central California and the Northwest.  For example, daily-record rainfall totals were noted on September 21 in locations such as Redding, California (1.22 inches), and Roseburg, Oregon (0.56 inch).  No changes in the drought depiction were yet introduced in the Northwest, but the region will be monitored as precipitation continues to spread inland.  Nevertheless, precipitation is beneficial for newly planted winter wheat, which by September 22 was 59% planted in Washington.

## Forecast
An early-season snow storm will wind down on September 26-27 across the northern Rockies, while rain showers will gradually end in the Southeast.  Meanwhile, a slow-moving cold front—and its associated surge of cold air—will reach the nation’s mid-section toward week’s end before weakening.  A frontal remnant will move into the South and East early next week, while Pacific energy will arrive in the Northwest.  Associated with the cold front, late-week precipitation totals of 1 to 2 inches can be expected across portions of the nation’s mid-section.  Starting on September 27, heavy precipitation (locally 4 to 8 inches or more) will develop in the Pacific Northwest.
The NWS 6- to 10-day outlook for October 1-5 calls for near- to above-normal temperatures nationwide, except for cooler-than-normal conditions in a small area centered on the Four Corners region.  Meanwhile, near- to below-normal precipitation across the majority of the U.S. will contrast with wetter-than-normal weather in the Pacific Northwest and a broad area stretching from the Gulf Coast into the lower Great Lakes region.
