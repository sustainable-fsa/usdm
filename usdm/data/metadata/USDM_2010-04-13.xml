# US Drought Monitor — April 13, 2010

## Introduction
Early in the week, a slow-moving cold front and an associated wave of low pressure in the Nation’s midsection produced showers and thunderstorms from the north-central Rockies and central Plains eastward to the middle Mississippi Valley and lower Great Lakes.  The front finally crept off the Atlantic Coast by late Friday and early Saturday, dropping light rain (0.5 to 1 inch) on the eastern third of the U.S. and finally ending the unseasonable warmth (highs in the 80s and 90sF) in the East. During the last half of the period, a series of storm systems impacted the West, bringing unsettled and cool weather.  Thundershowers also soaked southern sections of Florida and Texas, while light rain fell from the western Corn Belt to the central Appalachians in association with a stationary front. By Tuesday morning, low pressure was located over Wyoming with a trailing cold front, generating a band of strong thunderstorms from the northern Great Plains southward to the central High Plains.

## Alaska and Hawaii
In Alaska, colder air enveloped most of the state, slowing the spring snow melt. Significant precipitation, however, was limited to some western, southern, and southeastern sections, missing much of the interior D0 region. An exception to this occurred in south-central Alaska where 0.75 to 1.50 inches of precipitation fell, slightly trimming away the D0 edge in southwestern and south-central Alaska, from Iliamna to Talkeetna.
In Hawaii, continued trade wind shower activity dropped moderate to heavy rains on Kauai, especially across the central third of the island (e.g., Mount Waialeale recorded at least 20 inches of rain between 8:45 am HST April 6 to 8:45 am HST April 13), improving conditions from D1 to D0 in the north-central interior.  Although rainfall also increased across southeastern Kauai where D2 remained, locals reported that pastures have yet to recover from past dryness. This included the first three months of 2010 when rainfall totals at most gauges on Kauai ranged between 30 to 60 percent of normal. Elsewhere, light showers continued across most windward locations while the leeward sides received little or no rain relief, maintaining conditions.

## Great Lakes Region and Ohio and Tennessee Valley
Unfortunately, moderate to heavy rains (1 to 2.5 inches) fell mostly to the south of the upper Great Lakes drought area where conditions unexpectedly declined.  With little to no rain, above-normal temperatures, deteriorating short and long-term indicators, very low soil moisture percentiles, and near-record to record low USGS stream flow levels (daily, 7-, 14-, and 28-day averages), abnormal dryness was expanded into northeast Minnesota while moderate to severe drought increased across northern Wisconsin and the western Upper Peninsula (UP) of Michigan. An impact designation of AH was made to reflect the growing short-term dryness in combination with the longer-term hydrological drought.  In contrast, 1 to 2 inches of rain maintained conditions across central Wisconsin, northern lower Michigan, and the eastern UP of Michigan, with some D0 removal made near Green Bay and across central lower Michigan, and D1 to D0 improvement across north-central lower Michigan.  Farther to the east, generally light rains (less than 0.5 inch) fell on the lower Great Lakes and central Appalachians, continuing a springtime trend of subnormal weekly precipitation while temperatures averaged 8 to 12 degrees F above normal. With most USGS stream flows dropping below the 10th percentile, and 60-day precipitation near half of normal, abnormal dryness was expanded eastward and southward to encompass western New York, northeastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and northern West Virginia. No impact label was added to this area as the growing season has not yet begun. In contrast, an exception to expanding dryness occurred near the Buffalo-Rochester, NY, area where 1 to 2 inches of rain was measured, and D0 was alleviated there.
In the lower Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, 1 to 2 inches of rain fell from northeastern Arkansas northeastward into northwestern Ohio, including a small portion of last week’s D0 in north-central Kentucky and south-central Indiana (now removed), but lower amounts (under 0.5 inch) occurred to the east.  With highs above 80 degrees F and another week of subnormal precipitation, deficits between 5 and 10 inches have accumulated over the past 60-days in central sections of Kentucky and Tennessee and northwestern Alabama.  Accordingly, D0 was expanded eastward and southward, and D1 was added where the largest negative departures (more than 10 inches) were located at 6-months. Since this was short-term dryness, an A impact label was added to this area as the growing season is underway.

## The South and southern Plains
Showers and thunderstorms (2 to 3 inches) provided enough moisture to maintain and even slightly reduce abnormal dryness in southeastern Alabama while preventing expansion of D0 into western Georgia and central Alabama. Similarly, heavy thundershowers (1 to 4 inches) across extreme southern Texas were enough to remove a small lingering area of D0(H).  In contrast, totals under an inch, with many locations measuring less than 0.5 inch, prompted expansion of D0(A) across most of Louisiana, southwestern Mississippi, southern Arkansas, and southeastern Texas. Although the winter months were quite wet, this spring has brought minimal rainfall, with 60-day precipitation less than 50 percent of normal (5 to 10 inch deficits). With the growing season well underway, an A impact was included as planted crops will soon require moisture for germination and establishment.  In the south-central Plains, from southwestern Oklahoma northward into central Kansas, D0 was added as 60-day precipitation continued to be meager (15 to 50 percent of normal).

## The West
The good news was that the unsettled weather pattern (cool and wet) continued for the third straight week in the West, slowing the spring snow melt, or in some instances, even adding to the mountain snow pack and seasonal precipitation.  The bad news, at least in the Northwest, was that average basin water year-to-date (WYTD) precipitation and snow water content (SWC) on April 13 was already at near-record low levels, especially in the northern and central Rockies and parts of the Cascades (between 61 to 80 percent of normal WYTD precipitation; between 59 to 73 percent of normal April 13 SWC).  As a result, most areas in the Northwest were kept status-quo.  The exceptions included some slight trimming of D0 in western Washington and Oregon where more than 2 inches of precipitation fell; D1 to D0 in southwestern Montana where 1 to 2 inches have fallen for three straight weeks; and in Wyoming where another wet week allowed for some removal of D0 in the east, and D1 to D0 in west-central Wyoming where 2 inches fell.  Nevertheless, the precipitation and subnormal temperatures were welcome as this weather extended the spring and summer snowmelt and runoff.  In contrast, the eastern half of Montana continued to miss the bulk of the precipitation (10 to 50 percent of normal precipitation during the past 60 days), and D0 was expanded eastward.  The A impact designation and line was added to differentiate between the short-term dryness in Montana (but long-term wetness) from the short-term wetness but long-term (H) drought in the remainder of the Northwest.
In the Southwest, spring “bonus” rains fell on most of California, with snow in the higher elevations, maintaining or building up the SWC in the Sierra Nevada.  At least 2 inches of precipitation fell along most of the California Coast north of Los Angeles, and in the Sierra Nevada.  This allowed for a slight shaving away of the western D0 edge in California where at least an inch was recorded; however, most of the heaviest precipitation occurred where there was no drought, so not many changes were made in California.  In north-central California, although Butte County received over 2 inches of rain, the Oroville Reservoir remained well-below normal capacity, thus D0(H) remained.   The precipitation was lighter as one traveled east, with little or no precipitation observed in most of Arizona, New Mexico, southeastern Utah, and southern Colorado. Modifications, however, were made in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah, as a reassessment was made to the Southwest.  This was based upon the latest WYTD and YTD statistics, and trying to be consistent with the other drought tools and products, especially in data sparse areas where new information has become available.  From this, D0 was trimmed away from extreme southeastern California, southern Nevada, northwest and extreme south-central Arizona, and southern Utah. This was based upon much-above normal WYTD (more than 125 percent of normal) and YTD (more than 150 percent of normal) precipitation, above-normal mountain SWC, large station surpluses, and continuing above-normal stream flows (from surplus basin SWC).  In central Nevada, D2 was changed to D1 in Nye County since the 6-month precipitation was above-normal, and the contours redrawn to better fit the WYTD and YTD depictions.  In northwestern Colorado, additional precipitation (1 to 2 inches) trimmed away the northern edge of the small D2 area.

## Forecast
For the ensuing 5 days (April 15-19), a cold front over the Nation’s midsection will slowly move east, triggering showers and thunderstorms from the southern and central Plains across the Midwest and into the Northeast. Rainfall should be heaviest across the southern third of the Plains (2 to 3 inches) where the front should stall, while much lower amounts occur in the Midwest and Northeast. Little or no rain is expected in the lower Delta and Southeast, northern Plains, and upper Midwest. A weak Pacific system is forecast to affect the Northwest late in the period. Temperatures will be above normal in the West, northern Plains, and upper Midwest, and seasonable to subnormal in the southern Plains, South, and Northeast.
For the 6 to 10-day outlooks (April 20-24), a change in the short-term (5-day) forecast is expected, with subnormal temperatures and above-normal precipitation predicted for most of the West, especially the Southwest. In the northeastern quarter of the Nation, both subnormal precipitation and temperatures are expected, while above-normal temperatures will occur from the lower Delta northwestward into the northern Plains.
