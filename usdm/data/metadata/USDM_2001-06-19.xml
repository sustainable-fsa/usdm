# US Drought Monitor — June 19, 2001

## Introduction


## Hawaii
Light rainfall was reported at most locations, but totals were modest and last weeks classifications remained unchanged. Many sites measured 0.3 to 1.0 inch, with a few reports of 1.0 to 2.5 inches at some windward locations.

## Northeastern States
Scattered moderate rains (1 to 3 inches) fell on Maine, but most locations recorded only light amounts, keeping D0 intact. A small area of D1 was introduced in east-central Maine, where low streamflows and 90-day precipitation totals approaching 4 inches below normal were reported.
Between 2 and 4 inches of rain (locally more) ended D0(W) in southern and interior eastern Pennsylvania. However, D0(W) and a small area of D1(W) persisted across north-central Pennsylvania and western upstate New York, where rainfall was less abundant.

## Southern Plains
Reservoir stores remained low (and D0(W) unchanged) in southwest Nebraska. Farther south, little or no precipitation fell on northwest Kansas, where D0 was introduced due to low streamflows and 90-day precipitation shortages between 1 and 4 inches.
Extreme southern Texas experienced its wettest week in several months, with many locations reporting 2 to 6 inches of rain. D2 conditions were eliminated as a result, but the limited areal extent of heavy precipitation allowed last weeks D0 and D1 areas to persist.
Farther north, yet another dry week led to a marked expansion of abnormally dry conditions. D0 was extended eastward through a large part of central and north-central Texas while D1 and D2 in western parts of the state slightly expanded. 30-day rainfall deficits grew to between 2 and 4 inches in the new D0 areas, and 90-day amounts were less than half of normal in the central and eastern Big Bend.

## The Southeast, Lower Ohio Valley, and adjacent Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys
An array of conditions was noted during the past week, ranging from heavy rains and substantial drought relief to sparse precipitation and slight increases in drought intensity. Relief was common in the south Atlantic region, where 4 to 8 inches of rain fell on east-central Georgia, interior South Carolina, parts of south-central and interior eastern North Carolina, and isolated sites across the Florida Peninsula and extreme southern Georgia. As a result, D2(W) was downgraded to D1(W) or D0(W) in east-central Georgia, the central Carolinas, and southwest Florida. In addition, D4 conditions in central Florida were eliminated, as was D3(W) along the immediate east-central Florida coast. Farther west, lesser but still substantial rains (1 to locally 4 inches) prompted a reduction from D1(W) to D0(W) across central Tennessee.
Most other parts of the dry region recorded near- or slightly above-normal rainfall, keeping dryness and drought intact. However, only scattered rains approaching 1 inch were noted near the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers confluence, in adjacent parts of the lower Ohio Valley, and across western Tennessee, most of Kentucky, and the Appalachians. These conditions, in concert with topsoil moisture, streamflow, and short-term precipitation deficiencies, prompted expansion of D0 into northwest Mississippi, east-central Arkansas, and part of northeast Kentucky while D1 extended northward into southern sections of Illinois and Indiana. With the increase in shorter-term precipitation deficits, the (W) designator was removed from areas west of central Kentucky and Tennessee.
Currently, drought indicators (including precipitation anomalies on different time scales) vary markedly across the region. As of June 18, 30-day precipitation totals were uniformly near- or above-normal, but 90-day amounts were almost as commonly below normal. Going back further, precipitation was 10 to 14 inches below normal since October 2000 in parts of the south Atlantic and Mississippi/Ohio confluence regions, and 2 to 5 FEET below normal since May 1998 at some sites. Also, the Palmer Drought Index indicated moderate to extreme drought across the regions northern tier and the Florida peninsula, but the Crop Moisture Index indicated conditions no worse than slightly dry anywhere east of the Plains. The Drought Monitor depiction is a compromise of these and other indicators, leaning toward those that seem relevant to observed impacts.

## West
Beneficial, heavy precipitation fell on parts of the central and northern Rockies. Between 1 and 3 inches were recorded near the Great Salt Lake, across northwestern Wyoming, and over much of Montana, with several reports of 4 to 6 inches received from parts of southern Montana near Yellowstone. This led to improvements from D3 to D2 in central Montana, and from D2 to D1 in southwestern and interior western Montana, and near the Great Salt Lake. Eastern Montana also experienced some improvement. However, long-term precipitation shortfalls still cover these areas, and even streamflows, which typically respond to a sudden period of wetness, rose only modestly. Thus, improvement was not as robust or widespread as one might expect.
Other areas across the West received little precipitation, and most maintained last weeks drought classifications. There was some expansion of D2 in Idaho and the 3 West Coasts states, and some increase in the southward extent of D0 and D1 conditions across the interior West, primarily for increasing fire danger and deteriorating rangelands.

## Forecast
A few of the nations dry areas could receive beneficial rains during June 20 - 25. Current dry areas in the northern Lower Mississippi Valley, peninsular Florida, the Northeast, and the lower Ohio Valley are expecting 1 to locally 3 inches of rain. Totals should remain under 1 inch across other dry areas, with 0.25 inch or less expected in the western Plains, north-central and southern Texas, the Big Bend and adjacent New Mexico, and everywhere from the Rockies westward (except western Washington). Above-normal temperatures are anticipated throughout the dry regions in the contiguous U. S., especially in the Plains and Mississippi Valley, and in the West outside the Pacific Northwest.
The 6- to 10-day outlook (June 26 - 30) appears more optimistic from a drought perspective. Enhanced chances for above-normal precipitation cover all dry areas south and east of Yellowstone, especially from the southern Appalachians eastward, and in the central Rockies and southern High Plains. Meanwhile, subnormal precipitation is favored in Pacific Northwest, most of Idaho, and the northwest half of Montana. There are some indications that warmth will cover Maine and extend from the northern Rockies westward to the Cascades, but cool conditions are favored in Texas, the Gulf Coast region, and Florida.

The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week.
