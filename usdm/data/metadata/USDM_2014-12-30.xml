# US Drought Monitor — December 30, 2014

## Introduction
Significant precipitation shifted into the Northwest, ending California’s period of favorably wet weather. During the 7-day monitoring period, precipitation totaled 4 inches or more in parts of the Pacific Northwest and ranged from 2 to 4 inches across portions of the northern Rockies. Lingering showers dotted northern and central California, but mostly dry weather prevailed in southern California and the Desert Southwest. Farther east, several disturbances crossing the Plains provided snow in advance of the strongest push of cold air in nearly a month. Snow was also reported as far south as Oklahoma and northern Texas, while generally light freezes were noted in California’s Central Valley. In late December, unusual warmth across the eastern half of the U.S. was replaced by cooler weather. Prior to the push of colder air, near- or above-normal temperatures had dominated the country for 3 weeks. Elsewhere, heavy rain soaked the Southeastern and Atlantic Coast States. The rain largely eased concerns about short-term dryness and drought development, but also caused local flooding. Rainfall was especially heavy, totaling 4 inches or more, from the central Gulf Coast into parts of the Carolinas. On December 23-24, a late-year tornado outbreak accompanied the heavy rain.
As the drought-monitoring period came to an end, a developing storm brought the promise of accumulating snowfall across the southwestern U.S. Any drought-related impacts will be covered next week, since nearly all of the precipitation associated with the storm fell after the cutoff time of 7 am EST (4 am PST) on December 30.

## Central and Southern Plains
Rapidly changing conditions in late December—markedly cold weather, along with some light snow and freezing rain—followed a period of relative tranquility. By December 27, daily-record snowfall amounts included 3.5 inches in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and 2.0 inches in Wichita Falls, Texas. Additional freezing and frozen precipitation arrived on December 29-30. Nevertheless, there were some small-scale changes (for the worse) introduced across the southern Plains, mostly related to an evaluation of long-term impacts of the multi-year drought on water supplies. For example, reservoirs in Texas were five-eighths (62.6 percent) full at the end of 2014, compared to 64.3 percent at the end of 2013. Historically, reservoirs in Texas are collectively about 80 percent full in late December.

## Hawaii and Puerto Rico
A storm system produced heavy rain in Hawaii, triggering local flooding. However, most of the rain fell in leeward areas that are not currently experiencing abnormal dryness (D0). As a result, no changes were introduced in Hawaii. On December 23, daily-record totals included 2.14 inches in Kahului, Maui, and 1.50 inches in Hilo, on the Big Island. Some of the heaviest rain fell on Kauai, where 72-hour totals from December 21-24 reached 29.07 inches at Kilohana and 18.20 inches at Kokee. On the Big Island, a blizzard warning was issued on December 24 for elevations above 11,500 feet. Since the storm departed, dry weather has returned to Hawaii. Despite the recent precipitation, month-to-date totals through December 29 remained significantly below normal in locations such as Lihue, Kauai (1.12 inches, or 23 percent of normal), and Honolulu, Oahu (0.55 inch, or 18 percent).
Scattered showers in Puerto Rico were heaviest across the northeastern part of the island. However, abnormal dryness (D0) remained intact in part of southeastern Puerto Rico’s, owing to rainfall deficits that date back many months.

## Mid-South
Precipitation totals were less impressive across the mid-South, leading to few changes. For example, a band of abnormal dryness and moderate drought (D0 and D1) stretching across Arkansas into western Kentucky was expanded very slightly on the strength of rainfall deficits that appear at time periods ranging from 30 to 90 days or more.

## Northeast:
Widespread weekly totals of an inch or more were common in the northern Atlantic States, continuing a December trend toward wetter conditions—especially along and near the coast. Small reductions in the coverage of abnormal dryness (D0) were made in eastern Pennsylvania and northern New Jersey. From December 23-29, rainfall totals topped an inch in locations such as Allentown, Pennsylvania, and Trenton, New Jersey, with the bulk of the precipitation falling on Christmas Eve. Farther inland, and especially near the lower Great Lakes, somewhat drier conditions persisted. Since December 11, less than an inch of snow has fallen in New York locations such as Buffalo and Rochester. From December 12-29, Rochester’s precipitation totaled just 0.68 inch.

## Northern Plains and Upper Midwest
No changes were made across the northern Plains and upper Midwest, where the coldest weather in a month arrived in late December. Several periods of light precipitation preceded and accompanied the return to cold weather. Outside of area of abnormal dryness (D0), Sioux City, Iowa, received enough precipitation during the monitoring period to secure its wettest year on record. Through December 29, the total of 41.36 inches (149 percent of normal) in Sioux City surpassed its 1903 annual standard of 41.10 inches. Farther north, the Red River Valley and neighboring areas remained rather dry at time periods of 30 to 90 days or more, maintaining status quo for the broad area of D0 and the small area of D1.

## Southeast:
Multiple periods of heavy rain brought large-scale reductions in the coverage of abnormal dryness (D0) and moderate to severe drought (D1 to D2). In fact, D2 was eliminated in the central Gulf Coast region, while the coverage of D1 was greatly reduced. Some of the heaviest rain fell on December 23, when Tallahassee, Florida, received 7.44 inches and experienced its wettest December day on record. Tallahassee’s single-day record for December had been 5.34 inches on December 2, 2009. Elsewhere in the Southeast, daily-record rainfall totals for December 23 reached 3.81 inches in Meridian, Mississippi; 2.54 inches in Alma, Georgia; and 2.37 inches in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Several tornadoes struck the South on December 23, resulting in four fatalities in Mississippi. It was the nation’s deadliest tornado outbreak since July 8, when four people perished in Madison County, New York. Heavy rain continued through December 24 in the Atlantic Coast States, where daily-record amounts included 2.83 inches in Augusta, Georgia, and 1.78 inches in Florence, South Carolina. Later in the monitoring period, another wave of precipitation spread across the South and East. Daily-record rainfall amounts for December 27 totaled 1.87 inches in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and 1.76 inches in Tuscaloosa. December 23-29 totals climbed to 8.12 inches in Tallahassee and 5.81 inches in Tuscaloosa.

## The West, Including California
With the storm track shifting farther north, significant precipitation overspread the Northwest. December 25 became the snowiest Christmas Day on record in Wyoming locations such as Lander (9.6 inches) and Cheyenne (6.8 inches). With precipitation spilling across the High Plains, December 25-26 snowfall totals included 10.6 inches in Scottsbluff, Nebraska; 7.7 inches in Cheyenne, Wyoming; and 5.1 inches in Denver, Colorado. Across the western slopes of the northern Rockies, precipitation was heavy enough to result in some very slight trimming of dryness and drought. Closer to the Pacific Coast, and especially in the Cascades, an interesting winter continued to unfold. Since October 1, season-to-date precipitation in the Cascades has generally averaged 105 to 125 percent of normal. However, with an unusual amount of the precipitation falling as rain, the late-December snowpack contained only about one-third to one-half of its typical amount of water for this time of year—except closer to 75 percent of normal in the northern Cascades of Washington State. This discrepancy—overall wet conditions but meager snowpack—has led to some mixed drought indicators, such as favorable rangeland, pasture, and winter grain growth and improved soil moisture, while concerns persist with respect to the possibility of limited runoff into streams and reservoirs during the upcoming spring snow-melt season.
Many of the same concerns persisted in California, especially given the return of drier weather during the last one-third of December. According to the California Department of Water Resources, the high-elevation Sierra Nevada snowpack held only about one-half of its normal water (roughly 5 vs. the normal of 10 inches) for this time of year. At the same time, California’s December rainfall left winter wheat rated 80 percent in good to excellent condition on December 28, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. However, California’s rangeland and pastures still have a long recovery ahead of them; they were rated 70 percent poor to fair by USDA on December 28, up only slightly from 65 percent on November 23. Due to heavy rain in extreme northwestern California (and adjacent areas in southwestern Oregon), there was some slight trimming of drought coverage.

## Forecast
For the upcoming 5-day period (December 31, 2014 – January 4, 2015), a developing storm will produce an expanding area of precipitation across the southern U.S. On New Year’s Eve, snow will engulf the mountains of the Southwest. Some of the heaviest snow will fall in northern Arizona, although snow levels dropping below 2,000 feet could result in accumulations in some desert locations. Meanwhile, freezing rain may cause holiday travel disruptions in parts of western and central Texas. Later, the storm will shift eastward, bringing a return of heavy rain (1 to 3 inches) to the South and East. Some sleet and freezing rain may occur along the northern edge of the precipitation shield. Cold air will remain entrenched nearly nationwide, particularly across the western and central U.S., with freeze-protection measures required for sensitive crops, such as citrus, in parts of California.
The NWS 6- to 10-day outlook for January 5 – 9, 2015, calls for the likelihood of above-normal precipitation in southern Texas and from the Pacific Northwest to the Great Lakes region. Meanwhile, drier-than-normal conditions can be expected in much of the Southeast and from central and southern California eastward to the southern Plains. Cold conditions will persist from the Midwest into the Northeast, but warmer-than-normal weather will continue across southern Florida and return across much of the West.
