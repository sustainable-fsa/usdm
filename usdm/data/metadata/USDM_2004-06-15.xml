# US Drought Monitor — June 15, 2004

## Introduction


## Alaska
During the first 14 days of June, rainfall totaled 4.51 inches (168 percent of normal) in Kodiak. As a result, abnormal dryness (D0) was removed from Kodiak Island and surrounding areas. However, short-term dryness (D0A) persisted across much of the Alexander Archipelago (southeastern Alaska), while long- and short-term dryness (D0AH) continued across southeastern mainland Alaska.

## The Central States
A new area of exceptional drought (D4) was introduced from southeastern Montana into western Nebraska. Occasionally hot weather and short-term dryness in those areas continued to aggravate the effects of a multi-year drought. In parts of western Nebraska, the January-May period rivaled 2002 for the driest start to a year in more than a century. January 1 - June 14 precipitation ranged from 40 to 50 percent of normal in locations such as Chadron, Nebraska; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Miles City, Montana. Farther south, moderate to severe drought (D2 to D3) persisted on the central High Plains, despite weekly rainfall totaling 0.5 to 1.0 inch, with locally higher amounts. Both winter wheat and ranges/pastures were rated at least 40 percent very poor to poor in Nebraska (47 and 43 percent, respectively), Wyoming (46 and 64 percent), Kansas (44 and 43 percent), and Colorado (56 and 54 percent). The poor winter wheat conditions in parts of eastern Colorado and western Kansas were not entirely attributable to drought; significant freezes struck the central High Plains on April 13 and May 14.
Meanwhile on the southern High Plains, where June 8-14 temperatures ranged from 4 to 6 degrees F above normal, short-term heat and dryness continued to take a toll on dryland summer crops. As a result, abnormal dryness and moderate drought (D0 and D1) continued to expand across the southern High Plains. In Texas, the percentage of the cotton crop rated very poor to poor jumped to 26 percent on June 13, up from 12 percent a week earlier. In contrast, heavy rains eroded D0 and D1 in eastern Oklahoma and erased dryness from northeastern Texas. However, a small area of moderate drought (D1) persisted, centered on west-central Arkansas. Farther north, cool (as much as 10 degrees F below normal for the week), showery weather improved topsoil moisture levels for pastures and small grains on the northern High Plains, despite underlying long-term drought. According to USDA, Montanas topsoil moisture was rated 24 percent very short to short on June 13, an improvement from 44 percent a week earlier.
On June 10 in Montana, Billings netted 1.45 inches of rain, marking only the second time in more than 5 years that the citys daily precipitation topped an inch. The other day was June 13, 2001, when 2.27 inches of rain fell. Much heavier rain fell farther east, providing some relief from abnormal dryness (D0) and moderate to severe drought (D1 to D2) in the central one-third of South Dakota. In south-central South Dakota, Winner netted 4.80 inches of rain on June 8, representing its second-wettest day in the last half-century behind 5.00 inches on June 12, 1977.

## The Southeast
Seasonal showers continued to increase across southern Florida, where there was an additional reduction in the coverage of abnormal dryness (D0). Month-to-date rainfall was extremely variable in southern Florida, ranging from less than 1 inch to more than 10 inches. Totals were generally lower along Floridas southeastern coast. June 1-14 rainfall amounts included 0.94 inch (20 percent of normal) in Fort Lauderdale and 10.19 inches (244 percent) in Fort Myers.
Elsewhere in the Southeast, scattered, locally heavy showers also provided some relief from abnormal dryness (D0) and moderate to severe drought (D1 to D2). Improvement was greatest across northern Florida, eastern Alabama, and southern portions of Georgia and South Carolina. Southeastern showers became more widespread toward the end of the monitoring period, when a broad, weak area of low pressure over the Gulf of Mexico moved northward into the lower Mississippi Valley. June 13-14 rainfall totals in Georgia included 2.92 inches in Columbus and 3.74 inches in Savannah. In northeastern Florida, Jacksonville netted 6.07 inches on June 13, boosting its month-to-date total to 10.05 inches (429 percent of normal). Key drought indicators such as pasture conditions and streamflows reflected recent improvement and lingering effects of long-term precipitation deficits. According to USDA, 27 percent of Georgias pastures were rated very poor to poor on June 13, along with 25 percent of those in South Carolina. The percentage of Floridas pastures rated very poor to poor stood at 5 percent on June 13, an improvement from 35 percent on May 30. In both Georgia and South Carolina, the percentage of river gauges reporting flows in the lowest one-quarter of historical readings for the date was 49 percent on June 15, down from 93 percent on May 30. However, Southeastern temperatures averaged as much as 5 degrees F above normal for the 7-day period ending June 14, maintaining large moisture requirements for crops and other vegetation. In Georgia, Macons high of 100 degrees F on June 12 represented its first triple-digit heat since August 2002.

## The Western States
Cool, shower weather erased primarily agricultural dryness (D0) west of the Cascades, but the long-term drought picture remained virtually unchanged across the remainder of the West. Locally heavy showers, totaling 2 inches or more in parts of south-central and southwestern Montana, western Wyoming, and easternmost Idaho, boosted topsoil moisture but had little effect on the water-supply situation. Farther south, warm, seasonably dry weather continued to strain drought-reduced irrigation reserves in the Southwest.
Of course, water-supply issues remained at the forefront of the Western drought. At the end of May, cumulative storage in Lakes Powell and Mead stood at 24.9 million acre-feet (8.1 trillion gallons), down 45 percent from May 31, 2000. The lakes, which currently account for 92 percent of the water in the Colorado River system, held 45.1 million acre-feet (14.7 trillion gallons) of water just 4 years ago. Agricultural and forestry interests also continued to monitor the drought, partly due to range conditions and the threat of wildfire activity. As of June 13, the percentage of ranges/pastures rated very poor to poor included 70 percent in California, 64 percent in Wyoming, 62 percent in New Mexico, 54 percent in Colorado, and 46 percent in Arizona. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, several wildfires were active across the West.
On June 16, the Peppin Fire near Capitan, New Mexico, was largely contained but had charred nearly 65,000 acres of vegetation. Other fires larger than 5,000 acres were reported near Alpine, Arizona; near Grants, New Mexico; and in northwestern Colorado.

## Forecast
For the next 5 days (June 17-21) the overall weather pattern across the United States is not expected to significantly differ from that observed during the last several weeks. As a result, showers and thunderstorms will remain active across the central and eastern U.S., particularly from the central Plains into the Northeast. Thunderstorms may provide some drought relief on the central High Plains, but excessive rain (4 inches or more) may fall in an area centered on the east-central Plains. Showers will be scattered across the Southeast, with the greatest opportunity for additional relief from dryness and drought along and near the southern Atlantic Coast. Farther west, a few showers may fall in the Rockies, but the remainder of the West will stay dry. The NWS 6- to 10-day outlook for June 22-26 calls for a likelihood of below-normal precipitation in most areas west of the Rockies, including the Pacific Coast States and the Southwest. In contrast, wetter-than-normal conditions are forecast from the central Plains northeastward into the Great Lakes States. Meanwhile, near-normal rainfall and above-normal temperatures are expected in the Southeast.

## Disclaimer
The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week.
